This episode will be about the Quantum Tron: https://www.quantum-systems.com/products/quantum-tron/

------------------------------

* Introduction
  - Florian
  - Background 
  - Ausgründung Uni

* General
  - size, weight, span, payload
  - endurance, range, speeds
  - how much payload is the sweet spot between a/c size and sensor capabilities?
    - what drove the size
    - "Seibel emphasises that complexity, cost and risk rise in a 
       non-linear manner with weight"
      - component complexity and availability
      - heat development and dissipation?
  - Quick assembly
  - Structure: carbon?

* Uses
  - Monitoring of "long" things: pipelines, railtracks
  - Grid'ing, cartography, crop monitoring
  - Other examples? Military?
    how is operation from ships different? -> landing spot might move :-)
  - Talk about typical payloads.
  - Data Link?

* Why VTOL? 
  - Isn't a cat launch plus net landing easier?
  - Complexities added by the VTOL
  - But: simpler wing design - only for high speed
  - Where did you get the wing cross section? 
    - self developed? why? how? where? Werner Würz :-) 
    - lift:drag of 20 - not so good for a glider pilot :-)
    - elliptical wings, as one should.
  - can you land in airplane cfg?


* Propulsion
  - electrical 
  - Zrafeoffs vs. combustion
  - Isn't there waaaay too much power for cruise flight?
    Also the props must be optimized for hover ....
  - Switching off two of them for cruise. Good compromise?
  - Sawtooth for using them at their ideal speed. Gliders :-)
      -> how does this fit with missions?
  - Use the rear motors for slowing down. Cool!  
  - Custom developed: 
    - motors
    - controllers
    - propellers
    - power distribution.
    why do so much inhouse?
  - Which batteries?
 
* Sensors in the a/c vs. sensors in the payloads.
  - how much in a/c?    
  - interaction between sensors and a/c: 
    steer around in circle to focus on a place
    (more efficient than hover, I guess)  

* Development
  - How did you get the idea?
  - Which "market studies" led to this configuration?
  - Hardware/Sw in the loop 
  - "enabling it to fly hundreds of simulated Trons at the same time"
  - how many did you crash during development?
    - and why? hardware, ESC turned off, human error?
    - telemetry and data recording.
    - This is more serious than model airplanes...
    - human error? -> checklists


* Control
  - What is the challenge for the transition?
  - diff motor speed vs. nacelle position
    which controls do you use for hovering, controlling a/c there?
    what are the wind limits?
  - Which sensors are used as part of the autopilot?
  - What aero surfaces?
  - Talk us throught the tilting. Challenges?

* Redundancy 
  - where?
  - what happens if a motor stops during hover?
  - which compromises to make things feasible? IMU voting.

* Flying
  - Skills for flying
    One button control -> why? target audience.
  - Remote control vs. autonomous
  - BVLOS -> what is required, legally?
  - Sensors for autonomous
    - flying predefined routes with expected free airspace
    - vs. "participarting" in the airspace.
  - Compare to copters?
  - Mission planning and control software
  - Autopilot: IMUs, GNSS -> how accurate?    
    
* In terms of components and process, how much does this have in common
  with RC model planes?

* Legals
  - where can you use UAVs?
  - airports, max alt?
  - autonomous flying - what preconditions?

* Who is the dog in the videos?
