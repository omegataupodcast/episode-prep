* What is the general idea? 
  - extract the carbon from the air
  - and then where does it go?

* How does it work
  - fan pumps air into ...
  - filter made of?
  - capture CO2 on filter
  - close chamber, heat, concentrate
  - Adsorption, Desorption
  
* The actual machines
  - How big are these machines? 
  - How do they look, components?
  - What other infra is needed? 
    . The towers
    . Process hall 
    . Control systems. 
  
* What chemical or physical processes are used?
  - what is the sorbent?

* Ingredients for operation
  - Electrical energy 
  - Heat for desorption

* Options of where it goes?
  - Geo storage
    . What are the conditions for geological storage?
    . In what state is it stored there?
    . How is it turned into stone?
  - What else could one do with the CO2?

* History of the approach
  - initial idea by whom, when?
  - when/how did Climeworks get involved?
  - what is Climeworks' innovation?

* How did the tech evolve over the geneation(s)?
  - Sealings
  - less steel
  - better sorbents

* Plants and development
  - First plan in Switzerland
  - Arctic Fox
  - Orca

* Maintenance, long term operation?

* Capabilities and efficiencies
  - how much CO2 can be removed per <useful unit of size>
  - Total energy/CO2 balance of operating the machines and building the plant
    . 90% sounds almost too good to be true. Is this independently measured?
    . What does this assume? Eg, green electrical power?
  - What kind of scale up would be needed to have a real impact on climate change?
    how many machines/square km/investment to compensate for all of humanities' emissions?

* Economics
  - 5-700 $ per ton -> That's too expensive, isn't it?
  - How does this number come down? What does it depend on? Use of the collected CO2?  
  - What about economic break-even? What does this depend on?
  - Aren't trees the better carbon-out-of-the-air-extractors?

* Plan for scaling up? Technically and financially.

* How do you see removal vs. avoidance in the overal 
  climate-catastrophe-avoidance strategy?
  - your perspective
  - does the IPCC report say something about this?
