Basics of Physics
-------------------------------------------
* A few of the basics about atomic structure
* Nuclear Fission and Fusion
* E=mc2 Energy and Mass, Binding Energy
* Critical mass.
* The role of Isotopes
* Atomic Bomb vs. H-Bomb

* What are the destructive effects? 
  - Heat
  - pressure
  - EMP
  - radiation?

* Would you say radiation (and long term area denial) is a side-effect?


The development of the A-Bomb
------------------------------------------
* Context: the Manhattan Project

* Plutonium Bombs vs. Uranium Bombs

* How it works
  - critical mass; must be assembled  
  - gun method
  - compression using "explosive lenses". What's that?
  - Can both be used with both material (uranium, plutonium)

* Technical/Engineering Milestones in the dev of the US Bomb

* Piles.

* Early atomic bombs; Nagasaki and Hiroshima differences?

* Key People


H-Bombs
------------------------------------------
* Basic Principle

* structure of the H Bomb, incl. the substructure of the secondary


* Fusion
  - Fission triggers fusion
    How does this work?
  - Teller-Ulam Design?
    . Reflective Shell, reflects Xrays
    . heat and compress fusion fuel. Why?
      . transfer via radiation implosion; 73 million bar pressure!
      . foam plasma pressure
      . tamper-pusher ablation (much higher pressures; most likely used)
  - Fusion creates high-speed neutrons that can then 
    trigger fission in non-enriched materials such as depleted uranium (up to 50%) 
    -> Multi-stage.
  - Staging leads to effectively unlimited sized bombs -> limits in transport
  - Fusion does not create fission products; but the fission stages do.
  - Role of the Tamper, heat difference.
  - Spark Plug
  - majority of current Tellerâ€“Ulam are fission-fusion-fission weapon
  - Interstage: "focus" four results of primary onto the secondary
    1) expanding hot gases from high explosive charges that implode the primary; 
    2) superheated plasma that was originally the bomb's fissile material and its tamper; 
    3) the electromagnetic radiation; and 
    4) the neutrons from the primary's nuclear detonation. 
    Seems to to be the key to the design. Secret!
    Which aspects are known?
 

* What are the engineering challenges?
  . efficiency
  . size/weight
  . reliability
  . stablity/storage
  How have bombs evolved over the decades?
  Should we talk about some? B61, B83?

* How do you vary the yield? 
  Variable yield weapons. Doesn't this waste fuel?
  - injecting deuterium/tritium gas
  - timing/use of external neutron initiators
  - shutting down the secondary

* why use a tertiary instead of just a bigger secondary?

* Key People  

* Other kinds
  - Boosted fission weapon
  - Neutron bomb
  - Radiological weapon
  - Antimatter weapon
  - "Dirty Bomb"

* Seems to me the hight of the dev was 1945 to 1970?
  Not much happened since then. Correct?  


Delivery Systems
-------------------------------------------------

* Small volume/weight, large energy release.

* Delivery mechamisms, challenges involved in those
  - accuracy vs. power of the bomb
  - Readiness, time to launch
  - ICBM - silos
  - SRBM - subs
  - Bombers



Creating the Fuel
-------------------------------------------------

* Refinement, Purification, Centrifuges
  -> What is Weapons grade, why do we need "purer" stuff there?

* How do you purify the necesssary ingredients?


Testing and Maintenance
--------------------------------------------------
* How do you test?
  - above
  - under
  - monitoring, test?

* Simulate

* How many tests over history?  

* Stockpile maintenance
  what do we do today now that we cannot test?


History and Politics
-------------------------------------------------
* Accidents, losses.

* Alltime readiness (Bombers in the air)

* Stockpile in the cold war and today

* Countries that have "the Bomb"

* Do nukes work as a (realistic) weapon?
  - Too much devastation
  - Only as a deterrent
  - Risk of inadvertent use? -> Bad deterrent?

* Is there an agreement among historians whether "it was worth it"?  

* Other countries
  - French
  - British
  - Chinese
  - others?

* What do we think North Korea has today?
  - Is the knowledge to build this stuff available?  
  - What are the engineering challenges?
  - Or is it really about the raw materials and their refinement?
  - What does a country like North Korea need to do to build a bomb? AKA "How to build a nuclear bomb as a developing country"
