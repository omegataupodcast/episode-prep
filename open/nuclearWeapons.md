Basics of Physics
-------------------------------------------
* A few of the basics about atomic structure
* E=mc2 Energy and Mass, Binding Energy
* Nuclear Fission vs Fusion
* Critical mass
* Isotopes

* Atomic Bomb vs. H-Bomb

* What are the destructive effects? 
  - Heat
  - pressure
  - EMP - how vunerable would modern electronics be to the EMP?
  - radiation - Would you say radiation (and long term area denial) is a side-effect
    and that the military uses those weapons despite them, not because?

* What kind of damage is expected from different yields? Some examples -
  radius of damages from a small yield explosion and a large yield
  explosion. 

The development of the A-Bomb
------------------------------------------
* Context: the Manhattan Project

* Bomb was before nuclear power plants!

* Basic Principle: critical mass must be assembled for detonation
  - gun method: propel core into hollow shell
  - implosion method: compression using "explosive lenses". 
  - Explain details about both.
  - Trade-offs?
  
* Manhattan Project built both, right?

* Plutonium Bombs vs. Uranium Bombs
  - Can both be used with both fuels (uranium, plutonium)

* Technical/Engineering Milestones in the dev of the US Bomb 
  ... and key people

* Who lay the theoretical basics so they knew it was possible?
  Einstein, right?

* Yield compared to today?
  



H-Bombs
------------------------------------------
* Basic Principle
  - Staging: Fission triggers fusion
  - Fusion triggers (one or more) stages of fission or fusion
  - Initial Fission is always implosion; no gun.

* Structure of the H Bomb
  - incl. the substructure of the secondary
  - Teller-Ulam Design?
    . Reflective Shell, reflects Xrays and gamma rays
    . heat and compress fusion fuel. 
      . transfer via radiation implosion; 73 million bar pressure!
      . foam plasma pressure
      . tamper-pusher ablation (much higher pressures; most likely used)
  - Role of the Tamper, heat difference.
  - Fusion creates high-speed neutrons that can then trigger fission in 
    non-enriched materials such as depleted uranium (up to 50%) 
  - Staging leads to effectively unlimited sized bombs -> limits in delivery
  - Fusion does not create fission products; but the fission stages do.
  - Spark Plug
  - Interstage: "focus" four results of primary onto the secondary
    1) expanding hot gases from high explosive charges that implode the primary; 
    2) superheated plasma that was originally the bomb's fissile material and its tamper; 
    3) the electromagnetic radiation; and 
    4) the neutrons from the primary's nuclear detonation. 
    Seems to to be the key to the design. Secret!
    Which aspects are known?

* Why use a tertiary instead of just a bigger secondary?
 
* majority of current Teller–Ulam are fission-fusion-fission weapon

* What are the engineering challenges?
  . efficiency
  . size/weight
  . reliability
  . stablity/storage
  - How have bombs evolved over the decades?
  - Should we talk about some? B61, B83?
    What are the yields,  TNT equivalent

* Variable yield weapons. 
  - How is it achieved?
    . injecting deuterium/tritium gas
    . timing/use of external neutron initiators
    . shutting down the secondary
  - Doesn't this waste fuel?

* Safety Mechanisms
  - how is accidental activation avoided?
  - it did work over the years, right? No explosions :-)


Other kinds of weapons, briefly
-------------------------------------------------

* Boosted fission weapon
* Neutron bomb
* Radiological weapon
* Antimatter weapon
* "Dirty Bomb"


Delivery Systems
-------------------------------------------------

* Delivery mechamisms, challenges involved in those
  - ICBM - silos
  - SRBM - subs
  - Bombers: Bombs, Cruise Missiles
  - MIRVs
  
* Tactical NWs (like: Davy Crockett) seem to be a rather odd idea.

* Interplay with warhead design
  - Size/weight reduction
  - guidance and accuracy vs. power of the bomb

* Discuss a few milestone warheads, maybe in use today?

* Are the warheads different for the different delivery mechanisms?

* Readiness, time to launch


Creating the Fuel
-------------------------------------------------

* What is Weapons grade, why do we need "purer" stuff there?

* Refinement, Purification, Centrifuges

* Which other rare elements are needed in addition to Plutonium and/or Uranium?



Testing, Design and Maintenance
--------------------------------------------------
* How do you test?
  - above the ground
  - under the ground (challenge of transposing the results)
  - monitoring, test -> CTBT episode

* Effects of atmospheric nuclear testing on the environment/climate.

* How many tests over history?  

* Now that testing is banned, how are NW developed and evaluated?
  - Simulate: impact of modern computing on from-scratch development 
  - How is yield calculated without testing? 
  - What other parameters are interesting in addition to yield?
    How do you characterize a NW?

* Stockpile maintenance
  - What is being done to maintain the stockpile?
  - How does decay affect reliabilty and safe storage?
  - I seem to know that the NIF has a role there.
  
* Are we still developing new NW today?
  Seems to me the hight of the dev was 1945 to 1980s?
  Not much happened since then. Correct?  



History and Politics
-------------------------------------------------
* Permanent readiness (Bombers with weapons in the air)

* (Almost) Accidents, Losses of Weapons
  There was a B-52 above Spain ....

* Size and structure of the stockpile in the cold war and today

* Which countries have NW?
  - US
  - Russia
  - French
  - British
  - Chinese
  - Israel
  - India
  - Pakistan
  - others?

* Why do countries want the bomb? Can't use it, realistically!?

* Is there an agreement among historians whether "it was worth it" to 
  have NW in the cold war? 

* What do we think North Korea has today?
  - Is the knowledge to build NW available?  
  - What are the engineering challenges that are not public knowledge?
  - Or is it really about the raw materials and their refinement process?
  
* How long would it take a developed country to build a nuke
  if they decided to do so?
  - starting from unclassified, available scientific data, 
  - no financial constraints)
  - Cost and time?
