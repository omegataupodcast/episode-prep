* Brief Intro Antoine
  (we'll talk about your pre-Airbus experience towards the end of the conversation)
  - flight and ground test
  - Managing >100 flight test professionals

* What is the current product line of Airbus helicopters
  (to demonstrate the range of flight test challenges)

* How do test pilots and test engineers collaborate
  - before the campaign (while it is designed)
    . probably also other engineers involved? 
      how does the knowledge about what needs testing 
      in a particular new helo get to the FT community?
  - during the campaign
  - during the flights
  

* Is there a distinction in flight test responsibilities 
  between civilian and military?
  - and operationally? 
    Coordination with the flight test folks of "the customer"?
  - everything in Donauw√∂rth?
  
* Production flight test vs. development flight test

* Research and development themes and prototyping 
  - what are some of these themes and prototypes you have worked on?
  - what are the main things of helo innovation currently?
    . Fenestron is no longer "new", right?
    . 5 blade rotor - why? what is advantageous?
    . is it mostly software and avionics? Examples?
  QUESTION: Can you mention a few in advance so I can prepare?

* QUESTION: Can we walk through in detail through a particular test campaign?
  - talk through specific test points and challenges,
  - and also about the analysis that leads to those 
  (I would love to explore this in real detail, 30 or 45 minutes)

* You landed on Aconcagua, together with Alexander Neuhaus
  - how hight?
  - what is the challenge?
  - With how much power reserves did you land?
  - What is the flying challenge 
    . except having no reserves?
    . strong wind - good or bad? (transition lift)
    . role of avionics and autopilot
  - Prep?
  - Safety gates and strategies
  - Ecureuil still has overall record (2005), right?
    

* What are some of the routine test points, and which special 
  instrumentation/sensors are used?
  - strains
  - vibrations 
  
* Special airspace and "range instrumentation" to do the work?
  
* Is the City Airbus also part of your responsibility?

* Talk about previous experience
  - RNLAF
    - Talk a bit about your role(s) there.
  - ETPS 
    - Talk about the FTE track at the school?

* "At the moment flight test experience on 60+ rotary wing and fixed 
   wing aircraft incl. First Flights."
   et's geek out a bit over some of the helos you have flown. 
  - How are they different?
  - Quirks?
