* Who are you 
  - background
  - previous work

* 10,000 ft view
  - Who is behind it except you
    . Dagfinn Gangsaas fbw
    . Jim Payne test pilot (perlan)
    . Loek Boermans
  - What is the goal of the project
    . existing fuselage of an ASH 30 - why?
      why two seater
    . open class
    . 28m
    . FBW
  - why do you want high aspect
    . aspect ratio 53 - how to get it stiff? - eta 52, concordia 57
    . why not add the fbw to existing wings, was there also "wing innovation"? which?
    . thin high aspect wing
  - What triggered it

    . high loading
  - Designed for which weather / use case?
    probably different than the OLC-based weather model used in 
    the design of the Ventus 3
  
* Structure and Aerodynamics
  - why is a thinner wing better
    . flapped of course for slow flight
    . only possible because of FBW, no mechanics?
  - how are the airfoils designed? 
    . how are they different, new?
    . lift plateau in the polar - how do you design this?
    . iterative airfoil design - what do you optimize for?    
  - why do you want high loading    
    . not just in wing, but 2 seater + motor -> heavy fuselage 
      -> bending moment on wing 950kg w/o water
  - how do you build such a thing but still stiff wing?
    . prepregs in the wing. 
    . What is this? 
    . why? challenge?
    . other tricks to build strcuture?
    . 183 layers of carbon at inner spar
  - boundary layer control
    . how does it work?
    . is it controlled by computer or manually?
    . How big is the effect? Glide ratio, sink rate...

  - materials
    . high strength fibers -> challenge beyond price? 
      stiffness & tensile strength
    . relationship to x-57; material data  

* Build this thing yourself?
  - Built your own autoclave
  - molds

  - why no SH-style bends :-) ?
  - non-linear elastic vortex lattice method
  - automatic fem model generation?

* Structure test
  - 16 ft of flex
  - The failure :-(
  - What happend? How did you figure it out?

* FBW
  - fist glider with fbw
    . akafliegs are also going in this dir
  - controls what? 
    . flaps
    . ailerons
    . but not tail, why?
  - benefits
	- what sensors?

    "I need to correct you there, all six flaps have ..."
    
  - mechanical backup?
    . how does this not interfere with the FBW?
    . is this the way to get "force feedback?"
    . there's still a flap handle, right?
      but unconnected mechanically.     
    
    . auto flap setting
      discrete flap settings or continuous?
      flap settings based on which input params?
      expect better perf b/c of fbw flaps?
 
 
    . reduction of adverse yaw 
      less rudder
      how?
    . load alleviation, flutter supp
    . custom control laws
      example?
      change in flight

  - architecture, redundancy. 3 computers, 3 buses.
    what actuators?
  - how/why is flap segementation a safety aspect?
  - what is harder to get right:

  - which programming languages, hardware.  
    Servo Temperature. Cabling? Connectors!
  
    mechanical mixer or FBW flight law?
    
* Experience, performance?  
  - how many hours?
  - whats state of testing? vne limite?
  - how do you go about flight testing this?
    you have to rely on FBW from the start
    professional: Jim Payne
  - role of existing models now in flight test?
  - rolls nicely, no stall surprises
  - ever had a failure in the FBW?
  
  
* From here
  - certificated how?
  - experimental not in cs22. 
    Wing loading too high, stall speed too high 
    what is approach speed?
  - fbw in series gliders?
  - prepregs in glider manufacturing?
  - what did you learn, what would you do differntly in the your next one?

* Did some one already accuse of taking the pilot skill out of flying?  

* Other projects you've designed
