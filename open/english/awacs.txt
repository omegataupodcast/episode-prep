* Overview over NATO AEW
  - Mission overview (more details later)
    . what kinds of pizza do you deliver?
    . where do I order?
  - Multi-Country. Organized how?
    . NATO's Airborne Early Warning & Control Programme
  - how many a/c?
    . 14 Boeing E-3A in Geilenkirchen
    . 7 E-3D in Waddingten (operated by RAF)
  - A Bit of history
    . 35 years this year? - nice livery!
    . Why did NATO decide to do AEW itself? 
      ANd not all kinds of other things?
    
   
* Aircraft
  - E-3, which variant?
  - Airframe 707 (not 135)  
    . how is it different from 707 except the radome?
    . Rather old. 
	  Production ended in 92
      Maintenance?
    . Engines
      E-3D has newer engines
    . Where do the pilots come from?
      Previous experience?
      Do you do your own training?
    . Cockpit: analog gauges or glass? 
      It a weird hybrid like the SOFIA 747SP: systems old,
      flight engineer, but still glass avionics
  - Engine upgrade in the cards?

* Radar & Cabin Equipment
  - whats in the radome
  - physical dimensions and aerodynamic properties of the disc
    diameter, weight
    produces lift?
    how much drag
    influence on rudder or elevator
  - what kind? analog, digital?
	. electronically phased/scanning?
  - performance numbers (as far as public)
  - specific capabilities (as far as public)  
    . vertical range?
  - Systems suite beyond the radar
    . There must have been upgrades since the 1980s....
    . Planned future upgrades?
  - Cabin equipment
    . personnel, roles, crew structure
    . consoles, what do operators have available in terms of equipment?
    . how do ATC-ers interact with the radar?

* Mission in Detail
  - Detecting bogeys
  - And controlling friendlies
    . Air-to-air engagements (vector to bogey)
    . Air-to-ground: orchestrate forces?
      but no ground surveillance capability, right?
      this was formerly the E-8, is it still in use?
  - How do you communicate with "clients"?
    Just radio or also data?
  - Airspace Organization when controlled by AWACS
  - Are there sometimes multi-AWACS in the air in the same theater?
  - Coordinate with other entities? Ground? Civ ATC?
      
  - Missions for NATO in regular peacetime (like now)
  - What would happen in an air campaign
    compare to Red Flag
  - Do you forward-locate to other air bases?
 
* Piloting 
  - seems rather repetitive, basically fly circles?
  - what kind of flying precision is required?
  - Who decides where you fly your circles?
    what kind of ATC coordination is needed?
  - do you notice the radome? Envelope restrictions?
  - range/endurance
      air refuelling?
      multiple crews??
  - Coordination with the mission commander?
          
* Example Missions in the past
