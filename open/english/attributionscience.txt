* Introduction Friederike and Institute

----------
* What does attribution science try to do
  Context: - does the climate change at all?
           - is this change anthropogenic
           - is a particular (extreme) weather event due to this change
  It does not answer the second question (even though we all expect the answer is "yes"         
----------

* What is extreme weather
  - criteria: Heat, Wind, Rain, Cold
  - how do you define thresholds?
  - Do you just look at meteorological numbers (temp, rain/time) 
    or also on when/where it occurs and the economic or health impact it had?

* Does global warming make extreme weather worse, or does it create more extreme 
  weather instances. Or are the two the same :) ?
  
* What theories do we have to explain these effects?

* How does it work in principle
  - Key idea: distinguish thermodynamic (global, slow) and dynamical (circulation) 
    causes because they are quite different.
  - Location-specific probabilities and then contrasting with what actually occurred
  - Location specific because global warming effects the circulation.
    (which "distributes" effects unequally)
  - basically statistical
  - how do you deal with the generally chaotic nature of weather?
  - Non-linearity: eg once a threshold is crossed, precipitation remains stable.
  - You don't really attribute a particular event, it's still probabilitic for a class
    ("xyz likely that this kind of event based on climate change"). 
    You can't attribute ONE PARTICULAR event. Correct?
  - Class of event vs. a particular event. What difference does this make? 
    Can't any event generalized?

* Is attribution the same as predicting? 
  - predicting as in "it will happen again every x years
  - or predicing as in "when we see this pattern in the atmo developing, 
    event will likely happen in the new y days"

* Steps
   - Step 1: What happened?
   - Step 2: Event definition
   - Step 3: Model evaluation
   - Step 4: Estimate likelihoods
   - Step 5: Interpret and synthesize
   - Step 6: Communication

* Several different methodologies:
  - Risk based approach. Run "current" climate model against counterfactual "natural" one.
    . Seems like the obvious approach
    . How do you know how a counterfactual world would have looked?
      remove aerosols and co2. What to do about oceans sst?
    . remove only one factor should give a more specific cause?
  - Boulder approach: how is it different?
    . Tries to disentangle the specific causes of a particular event.
      How?
    . Critic: you remove the thing of which you *claim* it is the problem. 
      Isn't that self-fulfilling?
  - Circulation-based approaches
  - Storyline approaches

* Evolution of climate models
  - Climate models had to evolve to contain circulations
    (is this only the atmosphere, or also oceans? Gulf stream?)
  - what are "coupled" models?
  - how do you simplify? If you run 1000s of ensembles, you can't be full detail

* The role of ensemble simulations
  - What are these?
  - What do you vary? How do you know what to vary?
  - How many ensembles do you typically run 
    (I read somewhere of 17,000 real, 117,000 counterfactual)
  - Ensembles vs. Re-analysis

* Instead of using a hypothetical world (antropogenic removed) 
  we can also just go back 50 years ... less "hypothetical". True?
  
* Problem of scale 
  - How do you represent small-scale extreme events (huge thunderstorms) if 
    the climate models don't go down to this scale?
  - What is a "regional climate model"?
  - If you run local models, how do take care of the boundary conditions?
  - Generally: how do you combine local and global models that run 
    at different scales?

* How do you get from a model run result to a probability?
  How do you quantify uncertainty?

* Do the different methodologies agree if applied to the same event?

* What makes an event "easy" to attribute?
  Are the different kinds (heat, rain, etc) differently complex to attribute?
 
* How can you validate the "predictions" or attributions/probabilities 
  of your attributions? 
  - What's your equivalent of 3 sigma.
  - What about built-in biases?
  - How do you correct?
   
  Example: Krymsk, southwest Russia, near the Black Sea, caused by catastrophic rains 
  in July 2012, was no exception (Fig. 1). Writing in Nature Geoscience, 
  Meredith et al.1 now show that — exceptionally for such a localized event — it is 
  possible to attribute this flood to climate change: they present convection-resolving 
  simulations that suggest that incremental warming of sea surface temperature (SST) 
  in the Black Sea over the past few decades has led to an abrupt amplification of 
  convective precipitation.
  -> ran a particular model. How do you ensure it is not self-fulfilling? 

* Extreme weather event vs. long-term general trend: 
  the latter's attribution is trivial with climate models. isn't it?

* What is Weather@Home and how does it help?

* A little bit of history
  - How old is the field? 
  - Key enablers

* The future
  - What is still missing from the approach
  - what can be improved? 
  - How?
