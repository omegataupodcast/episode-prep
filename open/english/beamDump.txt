* Introduction Marco

* What does the Targets group do
  - what are targets
  - those as a particle source 
    (fixed target impact of beam)
  - those for controlling the beam
    (collimators, scrapers)
  - those for dumping the beam 
    (focus of this discussion)
  - How many of those do you have at LHC complex?  
  
* Beam dump, why
  - Lifecyle of LHC (fill, science, dump)  
  - But also "emergency" dump triggered by protection system
  - 200 dump events per year (surprised, would have expected more.)

* General idea
  - lot of mass
  - beam impacts
  - heats up target via particle showers
  - sizes, masses, dimensions
  
    
* How do you get the beam into the dump
  - kicker magnets
    . small but fast vertical kicker
    . then larger horiz kicker that is always energized
    . precisely delineated mag fields required!
  - 3 rounds of beam after trigger
    . why?
    . the entire LHC ring is emptied in just 86 μs
  - beam gap for kicker rampup
  - dilution of beam for impact, circular
    . what happens to dump if these fail?
    . oh, and what happens to LHC if kickers fail?  


* General challenges of LHC beam dump
  - how much power/energy is transported by beam into the target
    and what does it depend on?
  
	# 560 MJ during LHC Run 3, roughly corresponding to the energy
	# required to melt 2.7 tonnes of copper. Released in a period of
	# just 86 μs, this corresponds to a peak power of 6.3 TW or, put
	# differently, 8.6 billion horse power. 
  
  - does the target expand when the beam impacts? 
    . Loud? Flash? Ever filmed?
  - heat capacity of target
    . core heats to 1500 C, expands, 
    . but cannot really because of mass around it.
    . mech stress
    
    # Although the steel vessel is responsible for absorbing just 5% of
    # the deposited energy, the short timescales involved lead to a
    # semi-instantaneous rise in temperature of more than 150 C,
    # generating accelerations up to 2000 g and forces of several hundred
    # tonnes. 
    
  - slow down "stepwise", different materials, which?
  - cooling to keep material stable and to be ready for next dump in time
    (is the cooling active?)
  - activation/radiation
    (the large concrete/steel blocks around it, only for rad or also for heat?)


* You built a new LHC dump in the current shutdown. What is different?
  - gap between beam and dump
  - purpose of entry window
  - what materials are stacked?
  - conductivity of heat to the outer layers. How?
  - failure modes of target? -> sensors in the dump; which and why? 
  - the old one had moved by a few cm. 
    Why? sims to find out? What done differently now?
  - How do you transport it down to the cavern?


* Internal (PS, or was it SPS?) vs. external (LHC) beam dumps
  - what is (interestingly) different in (S)PS dump?
    # 4.4 m of isostatic graphite, 20 cm of a molybdenum alloy and 40 cm of pure tungsten
  - Cooling: 
    . copper-alloy jacket
    . stainless-steel cooling pipes and the copper alloy
    . air-cooled
    . seamless 15 mm-thick stainless-steel hollow cylinder
    . massive, multi-layered external shield comprising an inner 
      layer of 50 cm of concrete, followed by 1 m of cast iron and 
      an external layer 40 cm of marble)
  - sinusoidal
  - which of the two is more challenging? Why?

* Challenges from HL-LHC
  - more energy
  - higher freq of dumps
  - cavern size as a limit?
  
* What about the even higher energies in FCC?
