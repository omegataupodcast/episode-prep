That is dangerous to say, I might exploit this :-)



* Quick recap of your career

* What did you fly operationally?

* Test Pilot school - memorable moment?

* The F-22
  - What was the philosophical idea behind the f-22?
    - F-16 it was the LWF, basically a lesson learned from the not-so-super F-4 in Vietnam
    - Which experience guided the F-22? Operation Desert Storm?
  - Purpose: Air Superiority, F-15 replacement
    . A2G? "F-22E Strike Raptor" :-)
  - Generations F-16 -> F-22 -> F-35. Differences. 
    . sidestick - does it move
    . cockpit view compared to F-16 or F-15
  - Aiframe
    . wing etc.
    . leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers,
    . how does speed brake work? do you feel any change in attitude?
  - How do you use with Thrust Vectoring
    . thrust vector only in pitch (unlike X-31)
    . "supermaneouverability"
      capable of flying at trimmed alpha of over 60° while maintaining roll
      control and performing maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn)
      and Pugachev's Cobra.[103] T
  - Supercruise
    . how fast?
    . how? Just engines? (internal weapons)
    . useful for what?
  - Can you tell about the use of stealth?
    . what technique to achieve stealth? RAM or shape?
    . internal weapons bay
  - Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit
    . The o2 issue. What was it, and has it been resolved?
  - Sensors
	. AN/ALR-94 electronic warfare system
	  a passive radar detector with more than 30 antennas blended into the wings 
	  and fuselage for all-round radar warning receiver (RWR) coverage. 
	. AN/AAR-56 infrared and ultraviolet Missile Launch Detector (MLD)
	  uses six sensors to provide full spherical infrared coverage
	. AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar
	  low-observable, active-aperture, electronically scanned array that 
	  can track multiple targets under any weather conditions. The radar changes 
	  frequencies more than 1,000 times per second to lower interception probability 
	  and has an estimated range of 125–150 mi (201–241 km) 
	. Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) suite. 
  - What is "sensor fusion"
    . Can you say how this is then improved on in the 35?
    . It is said that the F-22 can serve as a "Mini AWACS" - means?
    . Wouldn't a two-seater be useful?
  - Operational Test? 
    . What did you do?
    . You also flew the F-117?
  - Why only 180 airframes?
    (leading into the next topic)

* Future aircraft (incl. the F-35)
  - Which experience did the F-35 grow out of?     
  - What did we learn for the air force from more recent conflicts?
  - Where does future a/c development go?
    . USAF is buying more F-15 (career starting to look like the B-52 :-)) 
    . Now there's talk about a cheaper 4.5 gen to replace F-16 b/c F-35 too expensive?

	  Background: I fly gliders. The actual aerodynamic improvement, the pure gliding
	  performance, has been developing over the last 30 years, but relatively slowly. However,
	  what has changed a lot is "electronics" and virtual stuff:
	  - GPS and gliding computers (focus on the flying task instead of navigation)
	  - better weather forecasts, weather live view in flight
  	  - "Radar" to see other gliders in the vicinity and their climb rate
  	  - online platforms to see other people's flights and learn from them
      - future: automatic flap control to configure an optimal wing all the time
  
    ... so, do air forces need higher performing aircraft, or better "Intelligence
        in the air", sensors, situational awareness, etc.
  
* AlphaDogfight 
  - name sounds like IBM's Alpha ...
  - quick recap; all fights won
  - realistic? 
  - how about putting AI into a real airplane 
  - relationship between human pilots and AI, AI in the cockpit
  - thoughts on "autonomous killing"
  
* Your current work as a DARPA program manager
  - quick recap: what is DARPA
  - how does it work, what is its role?
  - temporary assignment
  - what do you do as a program manager?
    . generate ideas?
    . select ideas?
    . shepherd projects through bureaucracy?
  - cool stuff you are working on?
