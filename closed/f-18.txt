* A little bit of F-18 history
  - same generation as F-16, service entry in 1978
  - YF-17 in LWF competition with F-16
  - Evolve to F-18
  - Navy's first FBW, right?
    dynamically unstable?
  - ailerons? diff elevators? both?
  - fixed intakes.
  - engines 1:1 t/w
  - Marines retired just this Feb
  - and future: the e/f
    . 30% bigger
    . not that many common parts
  - who uses/used it Australia, Canada, Finland, Switzerland, Spain, Kuwait, Malaysia
  
* What makes it a (good) carrier airplane
  - slow approach speed, big wing and flaps
  - strong gear for "controlled crashes"
  - hook
  - 2 engines (F-35 first Navy airplane with 1 engine?)
  - wing fold
  - tie downs
  
* Flight Characteristics
  A quote I read: "F-18 is a very good aircraft. Handles well, 
  natural feel, doesn’t bite the pilot when mishandled. Massive 
  envelope. It’s always interesting hearing comparisons with F16. 
  Very very different."

  - Power-to-Weight ratio? Not quite like F-15 or 16, right?
  - Not enough fuel - always reported as an issue
  - NASA Test pilot once told me, his grandma could land it. 
    Could she? (Maybe really easier than F-16 because wider
    gear and no flare needed)

  - High AoA 
    . operationally useful range? 35?
      dependency on weight?
      reminds me of Finnish F-18 demo at 2019 air tattoo
    . LEX
      lex vortexes hit rudder so you retain authority
    . how is this tactically useful?
      isn't it risky to go to low energy? re-accelerate?
    . did you ever depart it?
  - how different does it handle depending on weight/load?
  - Talk about the "mech mode" in the FBW system

* Cockpit
  - Screens, at least in the C/D
  - How long to learn HOTAS
    . how quickly would you forget the not-so-often-used features?

* Weapons
  - Gun
  - AIM 7/9
  - The "usual" A2G stuff, plus HARM

* Avionics and Sensors  
  - Radar APG 65 features	
    A2G mapping mode. position target relative to ground 
    building/bridge.
  - Ground Mapping
  - FLIR pod
  - ECM  
  - NVGs
    
* Your pre-Blues Career
  - squadrons
  - missions 
    . Like F-16, a classic Multi Role Fighter
    . a2a and a2g 
    . did you fly both?
    . what is more interesting?
    . which requires more training?

* Aspects of Carrier Flying
  (we've had a two-hour episode on flying from carriers,
   so we've covered the basics)
  - how is taxiing on the carrier?
  - Launch hands-off -> automation?
  - stores eject button if soft cat shot
  - rather short final - why?
  - how does the Hornet handle on the ball
  - approach via AoA instead of speed - why?
    . 8.1 aoa. Maintenance Subpage. 3250 trim. 
  - HUD (and other) indications on approach
  - interaction with LSO
  - automatic landing?
  - Did you have a night in the barrell?
  - The ladder ... could you lower it from the cockpit?  

  
* Blue Angels
  - Basically like the Thunderbirds, just from the Navy :-)
    . There is friendly competition with the Air Force
    . And occasional joint training, eg just recently at El Centro
    . Seriously: Blues structurally similar to thunderbirds - Differences?

  - Aircraft mods
    . Spring on the stick
    . Gun -> Smoke tank.
    . What is the smoke oil?
    . where exactly does the smoke oil hit the engine?
    . how is the pipe laid from the gun in the nose?
    . how do you activate the smoke?
    
  - Your flying
    . how was the first two-seater flight in the "old" season?
    . which positions did you fly?
      which are harder?
      challenge of number 3 position?
      Slot: Role of Safety officer in flight
    . why primarily left turns in the show?
 
  - how do you learn this kind of flying?
    . new guys travel with the team at end of previous season
    . first flight in the two seater in the diamond

    . how to do precision formation stuff
    . checkpoints on the airplane ("Flying paint")
    . 25kg on stick
    . fly without gsuit
    . flying is hard - mental prep?
    . How does the training work at El Centro?
    . how much tighter is the formation towards the end of the season?
      how close do you get?
      Is this closer than the Thunderbirds :-) ?
      so do you ever "trade paint"?
    . how much concentration is needed after two seasons?
      Think about groceries during the show?
    . the role of trust in the team
    . how do you "escape" from formation, and what triggers it?

  - Flying vs. "Show"
    . You're a bit of a rock star
    . Pacing of the season
    . what do you do off season?

  - Weekly Routine
    - weekly program at the Blues
    - How to adapt to new show site
      impact of wind, elevation
  
  - Who does a better show? TBirds or Blues :-) ?

* How is the E/F model different
  - larger
    . heavier (less agile?)
    . more fuel (pain point of the Classic)
  - avionics different?
  - how is the transition training like? What can you take over from the C/D?
  
* The E/F in the blues 
  - How is show different for the Blues?
  - How does the transition work? 
    . completely new built show because "new" a/c?
    . or evolution of the Classic show?
    . how did you build up?
