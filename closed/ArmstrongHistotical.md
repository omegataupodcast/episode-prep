Intro Al

* Schweizer Deep Stall demonstration project
  - What is Deep Stall?
  - Why this project?
  - "aerodynamics were dominated by long wings rather than a long, 
     pointed nose or forward strake"?
  - "stability-and-control derivatives"
  - What were the modifications?
  - What kind of maneouvers?
  - Relationship to "real" airplanes? HARV, X-31?
  
* F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle 
  - The relevance of High Alpha for fighters  
  - Precursor research: theory, tunnel, slower (Schweizer?)
  - Why the F-18?
    
  - Phase 1
    - Initially no modifications: up to 55 deg
      (Einar Enevoldson -> Perlan)
    - This phase used to work on research techniques. Such as?
    - How were the characteristics observed?
      yarn tufts, smoke generators, anti-freeze with dye in it, 
      pressure sensors
      pictures from chase plane
    - Importance of Strakes, LEX
  
  - Phase 2
    - Modification: Vectoring (2D or 3D?); 3 Paddles
    
    - Up to 70 deg, High Roll Rate up to 65 deg
    - How exactly was the integration of the vectoring paddles
      and the regular surfaces?
      No special handles in cockpit for vectoring...
    - Custom Flight Control System
      Can be switched on in flight, regular one for t/o and landing

    - Isn't this high AoA also a problem for engine air supply?
  
  - Phase 3
    - Movable Strakes (F-18 has some anyway...!?)
      on both sides of the aircraft's nose
    - Instead of rudder, at high AoA
    
    - How did Vectoring and the strakes integrate?
    - Never seen them used operationally.

  - High Alpha kinda got out of fashion again, right?
    F-22 has 2D-vectoring, I think a Su-35 has 3D?

  
* X-31
  - together with MBB / DLR

  - also thrust vectoring and FCS
  
  - new a/c, but with parts from others: EAP, TKF 90, F-18, V-22, ... lots!!
  - a/c shape/layout? cranked delta, canards, vertical tail. 
  
  - competitor to F-18 HARV?
  
  - simulation tests on one of the X-31s showed that flight would have been stable 
    had the plane been designed without the vertical fin, because the thrust-vectoring 
    nozzle provided sufficient yaw and pitch control.
    
  - also 70 deg. 180 deg turn in post-stall.
  
  - late 1990s: VECTOR



* F-15B ACTIVE
  https://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/multimedia/imagegallery/F-15b_837/EC96-43485-13.html
  
  - An F-15 with canards and thrust vectoring.
  - Another one in this line :-)
  - STOL -> shorter runways
    - Demonstrated vectored takeoffs with rotation at speeds as low as 42 mph (68 km/h)
    - Landing on just 1,650 ft (500 m) of runway compared to 7,500 ft 
      (2,300 m) for the standard F-15
  - MTD -> Maneouvering
    - Thrust reversal in flight to produce rapid deceleration
    - Controlled flight at angles of attack up to about 85 degrees
  - ACTIVE
    - Advanced Control Technology for Integrated VEhicles
      Pitch/Yaw Balance Beam Nozzles (P/YBBN)
  - Was this fundamental research, or an improvement program specifically for the F-15?

  
  
  
* F-8 Oblique Wing / AD-1
  - Let's explain the shape :-)

  - AD-1 was custom built, right?
  - ... and AD-1 flew.

  - Why would one do this? Advantages?

  - Compare to classic swept-wing a/c.

  - Challenges?
    - Ailerons? 
    - Roll-coupling modes?
    - Other?

  - What was different on the F-8?
    - AD-1 was slow speed, up to 280 km/h.
    - supersonic - how is this a different challenge?
    - decoupling of the longitudinal and lateral-directional motions of the 
      unsymmetrical aircraft, as well as to satisfy conventional flight control 
      objectives.
  
* F8 Digital Fly-by-wire
  - we know what FBW is
  - useful b/c: lighter, more precise, easier to add redundancy
    and enables (unstable, thus more maneouverable) a/c
  - Why F-8?
  - Forerunner to all FBW a/c
  - "The heart of the system was an off-the-shelf backup Apollo digital 
    flight-control computer and inertial sensing unit"
  - Interestingly, all mechanical flight control was removed - FBW not "added".
  - later: the original Apollo system was replaced with a triple redundant 
    digital system.
  
  
* F8 Supercritical wing
  - what is a supercritical airfoil/wing?
    why is it useful? transonic/supersonic.
    a bit of aerodynamic basics...

less lift
  - Why the F-8? (easy wing removal)

  - used in practice?  
    - not in fighters, right?
    - C-17
    - "Supercritical wings are now commonplace on virtually 
       every modern subsonic commercial transport."  

supercruise <-  
  
* X-29A Forward Swept Wing
  - Describe Layout 
  - F-5/20 fuselage, right?

  - Also a carbon fibre "first": Wings needed to be very stiff. Why? 
    aeroelastic tailoring to control structural divergence
    (Concordia) 

    "just as good as aft"
  
  - Why?
    "The high pitch instability of the airframe led to wide 
    predictions of extreme maneuverability."
  - "three surface a/c". Which?
  - inherently unstable. 
    Why? 
    And is this good?
    40 Hz FCS
  - FCS had to be "careful" in order to avoid departure, so the resulting agility
    was not increased compared to classical a/c.
  - Also, F-16 is also unstable and FCS controlled. So what would have been
    the specific advantage of the FSW?
  - Was it a success? 
    ... including the use of "aeroelastic tailoring to control structural
    divergence", aircraft control and handling during extreme
    instability, three-surface longitudinal control, a "double-hinged
    trailing-edge flaperon at supersonic speeds", effective high angle
    of attack control, vortex control, and demonstration of military
    utility...
  
Lots of experiemtns: wings, alpha, vector, fsw, 
none really used

* SR-71
  (not clear what you worked on there ... I will just ask you about it :-))
  coldflow?
  aerospike

  pilots?
  
* Boeing 720 CID
  - Controlled Impact Demonstrator OR Crash in the Desert
  - research goals?
    - reduction postcrash fire through the use of antimisting fuel
    - acquire transport crash structural data
    - demonstrate the effectiveness of seat-restraint and cabin structural system

  - what were the challenges? 
    - Remote control?
    - what else?

  - How was the a/c instrumented?

  - What was the planned scenario?
    "... as the wings were sliced open by eight posts cemented into the runway "

  - Talk about the proceeding of the actual experiment.
    - remote control
    - markings on the ground
    - observation/filming?
    - "... the aircraft turned slightly to the right of the desired path ..."
    - So, was the experiment a success? 
    - what did we learn? where should we sit on airliners :-) ?
why ignition?  
  - In some sense, the crash failed. Why was this?

when was this?
- AMK principle idea wrong?  
- did he do t/o and landing?
- why only trim tabs?
- FAA research?  

* F-106A Eclipse aero-tow demonstration
  - why :-) ?
    Kelly Space and Technology's Eclipse Astroliner

  - Challenge: 
    - high wing loading. 

    - starlifter lifts first
    - High alpha during tow?
    - low tow, under the vortices.
      Use F-18 to find out where they are.

mishap in grafenwöhr

    - line tension
    - tow plane lifts off first.
    - engine off
    - landing separate; did they light the engine, or did
      the Six land as a glider?

  - It was a QF106 - remotely piloted?
  - tow equipment on palette

bit like virgin galactic - monster airplane
-> nothing
